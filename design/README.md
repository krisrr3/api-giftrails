## Purpose

The design folder serves as the central repository for:
- Architecture diagrams and design patterns
- API specifications and contracts
- System design documents
- Technical decision records (TDRs)
- Design proposals and RFCs

## Contents

Design artifacts should follow enterprise architecture standards and align with the Giftrails philosophy of making guardrails gifts rather than obstacles for developers.
