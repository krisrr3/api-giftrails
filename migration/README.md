# Migration

This folder contains migration strategies and tooling for transitioning APIs within the Giftrails framework.

## Purpose

The migration module addresses one of Giftrails' core principles: planning for migration from day 1 to avoid years-long migration cycles when new API frameworks or strategies emerge.

## Contents

This folder provides:
- Migration strategies and playbooks
- Version coexistence patterns
- Data migration scripts and tools
- API versioning strategies
- Backward compatibility helpers
- Migration testing frameworks
- Rollback procedures

## Philosophy

By designing migration strategies from the start, enterprises can:
- Avoid technical debt accumulation
- Enable gradual, low-risk transitions
- Maintain service availability during migrations
- Reduce migration timelines from years to months
- Support parallel operation of old and new systems

## Approach

Migration artifacts support both big-bang and gradual migration approaches, allowing teams to choose the strategy that best fits their risk tolerance and business requirements.
