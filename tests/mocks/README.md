# Mocks

This folder contains mock implementations and test doubles for your API.

## Purpose

The mocks module provides:
- Mock implementations of external dependencies
- Test doubles for services and databases
- Stub responses for API testing
- Fake implementations for local development
- Mock data generators
- Contract testing mocks

## Contents

Mock implementations enable:
- Isolated testing without external dependencies
- Faster test execution
- Consistent and repeatable test scenarios
- Testing edge cases and error conditions
- Local development without live services

## Usage

Mocks can be used in:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Local development environments
- CI/CD pipeline testing
- Contract testing scenarios

These implementations help developers test their APIs independently of external services, reducing test flakiness and improving development velocity.
