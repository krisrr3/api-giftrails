# Performance Tests

This folder contains performance and load testing implementations for your API.

## Purpose

The performance tests module provides:
- Load testing scripts and scenarios
- Stress testing configurations
- Endurance/soak testing setups
- Spike testing scenarios
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Scalability testing frameworks
- Performance metrics collection

## Contents

Performance testing implementations help validate that APIs meet non-functional requirements including:
- Response time SLAs
- Throughput capacity
- Resource utilization efficiency
- Scalability characteristics
- Breaking point identification

## Tools and Frameworks

Examples include configurations for popular performance testing tools such as:
- JMeter
- Gatling
- K6
- Locust
- Artillery

## Best Practices

Performance tests should be run:
- During development for baseline establishment
- In CI/CD pipelines for regression detection
- Before major releases for capacity validation
- Under production-like conditions for accuracy
