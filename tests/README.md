# Tests

This folder contains comprehensive testing implementations for your API.

## Purpose

The tests module provides testing frameworks and examples across multiple levels:
- **mocks/** - Mock implementations and test doubles
- **performance-tests/** - Load and performance testing
- **security-tests/** - Security vulnerability and penetration testing
- **system-tests/** - End-to-end and integration testing

## Contents

Testing implementations ensure APIs meet functional, performance, and security requirements before reaching production. This comprehensive testing approach supports the Giftrails goal of Day 1 production readiness.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- System tests for end-to-end workflows
- Performance tests for scalability validation
- Security tests for vulnerability detection
- Contract tests for API compatibility

## Best Practices

All test artifacts follow enterprise testing standards and include examples of:
- Test automation frameworks
- Continuous testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Test data management
- Test environment configurations
